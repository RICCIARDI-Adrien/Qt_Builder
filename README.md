# Qt Builder

Allow to easily build latest Qt version from sources on 32 and 64-bit Linux systems.

## Usage

Call `Qt_Builder.sh` script with as unique argument the Qt version you want to build (for instance `5.13.0`).  
  
Everything will then be downloaded and built into `/tmp` directory. At the end of the process, Qt will be installed to `/opt/Qt/<Qt version>`.
